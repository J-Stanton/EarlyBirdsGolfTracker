# Early Birds Golf Tracker
A simple golf tracking app used to save previous golf scores for the Early Birds golf community and calculate their handicap. 
The app also allows to enter your Stableford points and number of putts for the yearly competition, where leaderboards at any point can be viewed.
All scores are stored on a local database.
